Service module for https://github.com/ex-aws/ex_aws

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `ex_aws_dynamo` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`
along with `:ex_aws` and your preferred JSON codec / http client

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_aws, "~> 2.0"},
    {:ex_aws_dynamo, "~> 2.3"},
    {:poison, "~> 4.0"},
    {:hackney, "~> 1.9"},
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/ex_aws_dynamo](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_aws_dynamo).

## Configuration

### `decode_sets`

The default behavior of this application is to encode Elixir `MapSet` data to one of DynamoDB's three set types - number set, string set, or binary set; however, those DynamoDB datatypes will be decoded to Elixir `List`. If you wish to decode DynamoDB set types to Elixir `MapSet`, you can set the configuration for this application to include `decode_sets: true`.

For example:

```
config :ex_aws, :dynamodb,
  decode_sets: true
```

## Local testing

This application supports three test commands:

* `mix test` - run the normal test suite
* `mix test.options` - run the test suite with options enabled (see `config/test_options.exs`)
* `mix test.all` - run `mix test` and `mix test.options` sequentially

### Integration tests (optional)

The tests in `test/lib/dynamo/integration_test.exs` will attempt to run against a running local instance of DynamoDB - in order to run these tests, you will need both a running local instance of DynamoDB as well as a `config/test.exs` file (currently .gitignored) formatted like so:

`config/test.exs`
```elixir
use Mix.Config

config :ex_aws,
  debug_requests: false,
  access_key_id: "abcd",
  secret_access_key: "1234",
  region: "us-east-1"

config :ex_aws, :dynamodb,
  scheme: "http://",
  host: "localhost",
  port: CHOOSE_YOUR_TEST_PORT,
  region: "us-east-1"
```

(also available in `config/test.exs.example`)

Before setting the `port`, be aware that `integration_test.exs` will create and delete tables with the names `"TestUsers"`, `"Test.User"`, `"TestSeveralUsers"`, `"TestFoo"`, `"test_books"`, `"TestUsersWithRange"`, `"TestTransactions"`, `"TestTransactions2"` - be careful when setting the port, as these operations may affect your current tables if they share any of those names.

If you do not have a running local instance of DynamoDB and/or you don't provide a valid `config/test.exs` file, the integration tests will be ignored.
